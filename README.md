# Pressure-Study_Automation
Currently, operators have to individually select a pump pressure and volume each time when filling a new grease and container. This process takes time and is done on a per order basis. To be able to automate the settings used by the operators, data of time taken to fill each unit based on volume and pressure settings has to be acquired. To acquire large datasets, this acquision of data needs to be automated, which is the purpose of this project.
Currently, the focus will be to connect a raspberry pi to the volume sensor and pressure sensor and see if the data can be collected and stored into some storage device like a harddrive, and then manually extracted and analyzed. Overtime the goal will be to automate the storage process online if possible, and add some tools for making data analysis easier.
